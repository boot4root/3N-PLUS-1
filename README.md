# Collatz conjecture 3N+1 issue.
Hello. 
Here I am going to share any interesting information regarding the unsolved problem, the confirmation of the hypothesis.

What is a collatz sequence?
Suppose there is a natural number n. 
Follows rules:

If the previous term is even, the next term is half of the previous term, i.e. N / 2
If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1, i.e. 3n + 1
The hypothesis is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

example: 3 ===> 3N+1 ===> (4,2,1 infinity cycle.)
3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
